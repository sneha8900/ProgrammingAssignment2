## Compute the inverse of the special matrix returned by "makeCacheMatrix"
## above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not
## changed), then the "cachesolve" should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
m <- x$getInverse()
## Just return the inverse if its already set
if( !is.null(m) ) {

return(m)
}
## Get the matrix from our object
data <- x$get()
## Calculate the inverse using matrix multiplication
m <- solve(data) %*% data
## Set the inverse to the object
x$setInverse(m)
## Return the matrix
m
